### Project Requirements Document: Tongue Twisters Challenge

**Project Overview**

The “Tongue Twisters Challenge” is an innovative web-based platform designed to assist children aged 8 to 13 in enhancing their speech abilities, particularly those experiencing speech impediments. The platform features an engaging collection of tongue twisters that children can practice to improve their enunciation and fluency. By leveraging AI technology, the application listens to the children as they speak, converts their speech into text using the Python SpeechRecognition library, and provides constructive feedback on pronunciation, accuracy, and fluency. Incorporating gamification elements, the platform aims to make speech practice enjoyable to encourage regular use among children.

The project is driven by the goal of providing a fun, engaging, and accessible tool for overcoming speech challenges in children. Its success will be measured by the platform's usability and its effectiveness in significantly improving speech clarity among its young users.

**In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope**

**In-Scope:**

*   **User Registration & Management:** Unified account creation and management system without role segmentation, treating all users equivalently.
*   **Tongue Twisters Library:** A set of curated tongue twisters across varying difficulty levels.
*   **Speech Recognition:** Employing the Python SpeechRecognition library to convert spoken words into text.
*   **AI Feedback System:** Using OpenAI to analyze transcribed speech against original tongue twisters, providing feedback on pronunciation and accuracy.
*   **Gamification:** Incorporating points, badges, and potentially leaderboards to engage and motivate children.
*   **Data Storage:** Recording scores and progress in a database via Supabase.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   Direct interaction with speech therapists or other professional roles.
*   Integration of monetization features like payment processing.
*   Extensive customization options for tongue twisters by users.

**User Flow**

Users start by registering on the platform. Once registered, they access a dashboard where they can explore a range of tongue twisters organized by difficulty. Upon selecting a tongue twister, children practice it aloud. The platform listens, transcribes the speech using the Python SpeechRecognition library, and evaluates it using AI against the correct tongue twister.

Each attempt results in feedback on pronunciation improvements, with points or badges awarded for engagement, promoting ongoing participation. Users' progress is saved in their profiles, allowing tracking of improvements over time.

**Core Features**

*   **User Registration & Authentication:** Secure user accounts, treating all users uniformly.
*   **Engaging UI:** Bright, playful design tailored for children.
*   **Speech-to-Text using Python:** Employing the Python SpeechRecognition library to transcribe output into text.
*   **AI Feedback:** Utilizing OpenAI to generate feedback on speech accuracy and fluency.
*   **Tongue Twisters Library:** Carefully curated based on difficulty levels.
*   **Performance Tracking:** Logging results and progress within user profiles.
*   **Gamification Elements:** Points, badges, and achievement systems to sustain interest and encourage frequent use.

**Tech Stack & Tools**

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/UI, Radix UI, Lucide Icons.
*   **Backend & Storage:** Supabase for database management and storage.
*   **AI and Speech-to-Text:** OpenAI for feedback generation, Python SpeechRecognition for transcription.
*   **IDE:** Windsurf, a modern IDE with AI capabilities for system development.

**Non-Functional Requirements**

*   **Performance:** Quick response and feedback generation times, under 2 seconds ideally.
*   **Security:** Compliance with COPPA and GDPR standards, with encryption in transit and at rest.
*   **Usability:** Easy-to-navigate interface designed for children, minimal learning curve.
*   **Reliability:** Aim for high availability with a 99.9% uptime target.

**Constraints & Assumptions**

*   **Dependence on AI Models:** Reliant on the availability of GPT-4o models for feedback processing.
*   **User Data Privacy:** Protected with stringent privacy protocols.

**Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls**

*   **AI Misinterpretations:** Errors in speech transcription affecting feedback can occur. Mitigations include regular AI updates.
*   **Performance Issues:** Increased user volume may slow AI processes, necessitating scaling cloud resources.
*   **Data Privacy:** High importance of maintaining stringent data protection due to involvement of personal data.
